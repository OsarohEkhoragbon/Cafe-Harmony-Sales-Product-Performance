# ☕ Café Harmony – Sales Performance Analysis (Excel Dashboard)

## 📄 Project Summary

**Café Harmony** is a vibrant virtual café chain offering drinks, snacks, and light meals across four key city locations—**Uptown, Airport, Suburbs, and Downtown**. With an expanding customer base and growing demand, the business needed actionable insights to enhance sales, customer satisfaction, and product performance.

This project leverages **Microsoft Excel** to analyze a master dataset of **608 sales and feedback responses**. I applied advanced Excel formulas and created an interactive dashboard using pivot tables, slicers, and visual charts to communicate key business insights and support strategic decision-making.
